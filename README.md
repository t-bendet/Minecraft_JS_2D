well my original intention was to build a world object for each skin and to make the code as dry as poosible and
it worked kind of well beside a console log error when i bring back stone elemnts
i set the stage to expend and make more world and skins,but it took me too much time and i dident have the chance to get there
i read a lot about grids and how to make it responsive even withoue mediaqueries...that i dident had the time to implement
i found out that over 85% of coumputer screens are on a 19:6 ratio and i build the grid to this ratio
i build the metrix in such a way that each box will have it's own grid area
with a faw minor changes i belive i can randomize clouds ant stones but again there was no time
